AzureML-R-Quick-Start
=====================

This repository contains the data and code required for the examples in the Quick Start Guide to R in Azure ML Studio. 

The California dairy production and price data is in the file cadairydata.csv. 

Code for each section of the Quick Start Guide is in a separate .R file. For example, the code for the example in Section 3 is in the Section3.R file.

The code examples run in R, RStudio and in an Azure ML Execute R Script module. You will need to change which lines of I/O code are commented out when switching between R/RStudio and Azure ML.  Read the comments in the code to see which lines of code to change.
